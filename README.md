# GS-HOIs: Greedy Search for High-Order Interactions in Complex Networks

This MATLAB toolbox implements an information-theoretic approach to identify and quantify High-Order Interactions (HOIs) in complex networks. The methodology is based on a greedy search algorithm, aiming to efficiently uncover multi-variable dependencies beyond pairwise interactions. HOIs are crucial for understanding the collective behavior of complex systems where group interactions influence the system dynamics more than individual pairwise connections. This toolbox provides a practical implementation of a greedy search strategy to detect these interactions using information-theoretic metrics.
