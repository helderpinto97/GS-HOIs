# GS-HOIs: Greedy Search for High-Order Interactions in Complex Networks

This MATLAB toolbox provides an information-theoretic approach for identifying and quantifying **High-Order Interactions (HOIs)** in complex networks. The methodology is based on a **greedy search algorithm** designed to efficiently uncover multivariable dependencies beyond standard pairwise interactions.

HOIs are essential for understanding the collective behavior of complex systems, where interactions among groups of variables can significantly influence system dynamics more than individual pairwise relationships. This toolbox offers a practical implementation of this methodology using information-theoretic metrics.
